# Modeling in Python

To test the program:

## Unidad_2 Branch
In this branch we added functionality by beign able to evaluate a function and its error as well as accepting parameters to generate a dynamic system simulation, similar to that in branch master.

### Evaluating error 
We added a __noise generator__ wich help us model natural "noise" in a given real-life observated function. 
We are able to compare this observations against a theoretical model by mesuring the error between these two.
