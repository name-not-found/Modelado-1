# DYNAMIC SYSTEM SIMULATION

## Python version 3

To test the program use:

	:~/sh testing.sh

This program works with the equation a*x**n+b.

The program has the following params:
	1. The mode: use -f filename to use file mode or -e to use equation mode.
	2. The coeficient or "a", use -a initial_val final_val step
	3. The power or "n", use -n initial_val final_val step
	4. The constant term or "b", use -b initial_val final_val step
	5. The initial conditions, use -x init stop step
	6. The number of iterations, use -N number_of_its
